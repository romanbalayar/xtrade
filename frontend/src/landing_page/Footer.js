          Investments in securities market are subject to market risks; read all
          the related documents carefully before investing. Attention investors:
          Stock brokers can accept securities as margins from clients only by
          way of pledge in the depository system w.e.f September 01, 2020.
          Update your e-mail and phone number with your stock broker /
          depository participant and receive OTP directly from depository on
          your e-mail and/or mobile number to create pledge. Check your
          securities / MF / bonds in the consolidated account statement issued
          by DTC every month. "Prevent unauthorized transactions in your
          account. Update your mobile numbers/email IDs with your stock brokers.
          <br />
          <br />
          Receive information of your transactions directly from Exchange on
          your mobile/email at the end of the day. Issued in the interest of
          investors. KYC is a one-time exercise while dealing in securities
          markets - once KYC is done through an SEC registered intermediary
          (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not undergo the same process
          again when you approach another intermediary." Dear Investor, if you
          are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to issue a check.
          <br />
          <br />
          Please write the Bank account number and sign the IPO application form
          to authorize your bank to make payment in case of allotment. In case
          of non-allotment, the funds will remain in your bank account. As a
          business we don't give stock tips, and have not authorized anyone to
          trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone claiming to be part of
          Xtrading and offering such services, please create a ticket here.
